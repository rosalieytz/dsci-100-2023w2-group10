    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pulsar stars** are neutron stars that produce radio emission, which when continuously and rapidly rotated, produce a detectable periodic radio emission. In astronomical research, possible pulsar stars can be identified as **‘candidates.’** Candidates are characterized by the average value of different patterns produced by their rotations. Nearly 2,000 pulsars have been discovered, however there are still many more unidentified in our galaxy (Keith et al., 2010). \n",

    "\n",
    "*A High Time Resolution Universe Survey was done to collect data on pulsar star candidates using a radio telescope. \n",
    "Of 17,898 collected candidates, 1,639 were pulsar stars [positive class (1)], and 16,259 were RFI/noise (false candidates) [negative class (0)]. Pulsar stars are the minority of detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "These stars were characterized by **8 variables** from the integrated pulse profile and *DM-SNR curve (Dispersion Measure v. Signal-to-Noise Ratio curve)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dispersion Measure of a pulsar is the quantity of electrons between an observer and the pulsar, and it can be used to indicate distance from a detected pulsar (Pulsar, n.d.). The Signal-to-Noise Ratio is the ratio of wanted signal to unwanted noise; this ratio is typically low in pulsar stars due to received signals being low (Pulsar, n.d).\n",
    "The Integrated Pulse Profile is the “fingerprint” of the pulsar, which is used to distinguish pulsar stars due to their characteristic profile (Liu, n.d.). They are consistent from multiple observations (Liu, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The question we aim to address is:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an observed candidate pulsar star’s data (integrated profile mean, integrated profile standard deviation, integrated profile excess kurtosis, integrated profile skewness, DM-SNR curve mean, DM-SNR curve standard deviation, DM-SNR curve excess kurtosis, DM-SNR curve skewness), can we successfully and accurately determine if the presented candidate is a pulsar star?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we are working with is characterized by the following:\n",
    "* **Data format**: CSV.\n",
    "* **Multivariate** data set.\n",
    "* Candidates in separate rows.\n",
    "* Candidates described by **8 continuous variables**:\n",
    "    - Variables 1-4: simple statistics from **pulse (folded) profile**\n",
    "    - Variables 6-8: simple statistics from **DM-SNR curve**\n",
    "    - Variable 9: **class variable** [0 (negative class, non-pulars) or 1 (positive class, pulsars)]\n"

In Figure 2, we saw that pulsar stars typically fell in the left-hand section and occupied a greater height than the non-pulsar stars which were quite spread out length-wise in the right-hand section of the plot area; we concluded pulsar stars had a smaller integrated profile skewness and a larger skewness in the DM-SNR curve than non-pulsar stars. In Figure 3, a majority of the pulsar star observations were in the bottom of the plot area while the non-pulsar stars were in the upper-left hand side of the plot area; we concluded that pulsar stars had overall a larger standard deviation in the integrated profile and smaller standard deviation in the DM-SNR curve than non-pulsar stars. In Figure 4, a majority of the pulsar star observations were in the left-hand section and reached a greater height compared to non-pulsar stars which were spread out in the right-hand side of the plot area; we concluded that pulsar stars have smaller excess kurtosis in the integrated profile and greater excess kurtosis in the DM-SNR curve that non-pulsar stars."

    "Classification can be used to successfully determine whether data from a candidate pulsar star is indeed indicative of a true pulsar star. We chose classification, as the pulsar star data provided 2 classes, 0 and 1, indicating a pulsar star, or a false candidate. This fits in with the definition of a classification model; “predicting a categorical class (sometimes called a label) for an observation given its other variables (sometimes called features)” (Timbers, 2022).\n",

Using cross-validation decreases the influence of a unlucky data being selected for the validation set, as compared to if the data was only split once. Although splitting the data into more folds will be more accurate, we chose 5 folds as our computers were unable to handle greater folds. It has also been seen having more than 5 folds may only have an insignificant effect on the accuracy. We specified the model, inputting `neighbors = tune()` to evaluate the accuracies from a range of different K values. In `gridvals`, we specified the parameter for K to go from 1 to 100 by 5. In our `workflow`, we used `tune_grid` function to fit the model in each value in our range of K values."

    "**What we found**:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the confusion matrix plot, we found that 105 non-pulsar were incorrectly identified as pulsar stars, and 47 pulsar stars were incorrectly predicted non-pulsar stars. Overall, we found that our classification model trained by the H2RU2 data on pulsar star candidates is indeed successfully able to answer the question of  “Given an observed candidate pulsar star’s data, can we successfully and accurately determine if the presented candidate is a pulsar star?” because the accuracy was evaluated at 97%. However, it is notable that our predictions are less accurate when we predict an observation as a pulsar star (77% of predicted pulsars were true pulsars while 99% of predicted non-pulsars were non-pulsars). We think this difference is from the presence of more non-pulsar stars than pulsar stars. Since many observations are non-pulsars, any given observation is more likely to not be a pulsar. This accuracy can and should be improved to more accurately determine pulsar stars. Although the effects of a mis-classification does not present irreparable consequences, a more accurate model should be developed for determining pulsar stars, because mis-labelling a non-pulsar as a pulsar star or vice-versa may offset the work of researchers who use highly accurate mathematical calculations in their research. 99% accuracy in determining non-pulsar stars on the other hand, is quite significant and helpful in the field of astronomical research, as successfully determining non-pulsar stars still rules out the possibility of pulsar stars, providing meaningful information to researchers about possible candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Was this what we expected to find?**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We did expect to find this level of accuracy based on our prior research. Use of all 8 variables was expected to train a good classification model as these 8 variables define and distinguish pulsar stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Significance of Findings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings could aid in exploration of the interstellar medium. Only ~2,000 pulsar stars have been discovered (Skelly, 2017), therefore any additional discoveries would be of significant impact in the field of astronomy. Further discoveries of pulsar stars could lead to analysis of their sizes and masses, providing researchers with the necessary data to understand pulsar star behaviours and interactions which are not presently well understood due to extreme pressure and density conditions (Skelly, 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future questions this could lead to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How old are the pulsar stars found?\n",
    "    - How can precise measurements of the pulsar stars sizes and masses be determined?\n",
    "    - Are there areas of the galaxy where more pular stars are found?\n"
